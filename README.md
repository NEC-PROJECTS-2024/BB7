Introduction:

The automatic recognition of plant leaf diseases is essential to agriculture, helping in early detection, management, and treatment of diseases, 
thereby enhancing crop yield and farming efficiency. Currently, convolutional neural network (CNN) is the most popular deep learning algorithm in plant disease detection. 
However, CNN cannot capture the fine details of leaf textures, colors, and patterns, nor accurately recognize leaf diseases from different perspectives. 
To solve this problem, the authors presented an automatic recognition algorithm for plant leaf diseases based on visual inspection. 
Furthermore, a plant disease recognition learning architecture was created based on CapsNet, which relies on neurons to represent target parameters like dynamic routing, 
leaf pose and pattern, and effectively capture the plant leaf disease information from different angles or directions. 
Finally, our model was compared with several baseline methods through experiments on a comprehensive plant leaf dataset.
The model performance was measured by mean average precision (MAP), time, memory, floating point operations per second (FLOPS), and parameter number. 
The results show that our model consumed shorter time yet offered better recognition performance than baseline methods,
including CNN, support vector machine (SVM), and region-based fully convolutional network (R-FCN) AlexNet.
